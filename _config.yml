          Enhanced diagnosis of early stages of skin cancer using the method of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), improved by the technique of Learning by Passing Tests (LPT) to improve accuracy by close to 1%
          The experiments consisted of two models, a teacher model, and a learner model, mirroring processes occurring in human learning

            • At Western Digital I worked with the Firmware group in the RPG(Removable Product Group) department. The project was based in Data Analytics.
            • The teams used .map files for observing patterns in the firmware. However, many crucial components were being looked at manually leading to inefficiencies in performance.
            • The tool I developed parsed data from these files and converted them into a ubiquitous format, supporting SQL queries.
